Anti-malware software will continuously scan the network looking for any malicious pieces of code or data packets. Once they have been found the network manager will be alerted, where a decision will be made to quarantine or remove the item. Quarantining a file is very useful as it might not be affected and you really need it. By placing it in quarantine it will no longer have an opportunity to infect the computer whilst a decision is made.
