It goes without saying that passwords to access a network are critical to keeping a network secure. This applies to your home Wi-Fi when setting that up as anybody will be able to use your network. 

The following rules should be applied when creating a password:

- No personal information used in the password e.g. where you live or Date of birth
- Password should contain a mix of letters and numbers, including upper case and special characters
- Change the password every 30 to 60 days
- Use password verification by asking the user to enter the password twice during registration
