User access control can be used to set user rights for all the folders (directories) and files on the network servers.

- For example, users may not be able to view certain folders and if they can, they can be prevented from saving fi les into them or deleting files from them but are only allowed to view and use the files in them. 
- User access levels can also be applied to the files themselves. For example, they may only be allowed to ‘read’ them and cannot write to them, edit them or delete them.

The fewer users who are able to access files then the more secure they are.
