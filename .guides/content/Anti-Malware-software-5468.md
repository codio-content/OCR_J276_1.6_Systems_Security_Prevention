Software should be installed to prevent malware (see lesson 1) from entering the system or removing it if it has.

### Using a database of malware definitions
Many anti-malware programs scan for malware using a database of known malware definitions (also called signatures). These definitions have information of what the malware does and how to recognise it. If the anti-malware program detects a file that matches the definition, it will flag it as potential malware. This requires regular updates to include newly developed malware.

### Heuristics
Another way anti-malware software detects malware is by a form of analysis called heuristics. Heuristics identifies malware by behaviors and characteristics, instead of comparing against a list of known malware.
Heuristics refers to a set of rules used to detect malicious behaviour without having to uniquely identify the program responsible for it.
It could include the following rules for identifying malware:

- a program which tries to copy itself into other programs e.g. a virus
- a program which tries to write directly to the disk
- a program which tries to remain resident in memory after it has finished executing
- a program which decrypts itself when run – malware often do this to remain hidden from the malware definitions method above
- a program which attempts to manipulate (copy, delete, modify, rename, replace  and so forth) files which are required by the operating system
