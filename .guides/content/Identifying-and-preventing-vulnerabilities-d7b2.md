In this lesson we will look at how organisations should check the security of their networks and the measures they should introduce to ensure its integrity and security.

**Penetration testing** is the testing of a computer system to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. 
The main objective is to determine security weaknesses. It can also be used to test an organisation’s security policy, the security awareness of the users, and the organisation’s ability to identify and respond to security incidents.

**Black box testing** is also called ‘blind testing’ because testers are given very little or no information prior to the penetration test. The testers have to find their own way into the network without any knowledge of usernames and passwords.
Black-box testing is more realistic as it is simulating everyday attacks and will give a realistic indication of potential threats to the network.

**White box testing** simulates hacking by ‘insiders’, people who have full knowledge of the network. It is also called ‘full disclosure’ testing as the testers are given details of items such as IP addresses, source code, network protocols and even login names and passwords.

**Network forensics** is the monitoring, recording and analysis of network events for two purposes: 
To help guard against attacks on the security of the network. Software can be used to analyse any unusual activity made by network users as well as external threats.
For law enforcement - the analysis can be used as legal evidence if prosecutions are brought against the perpetrators.
