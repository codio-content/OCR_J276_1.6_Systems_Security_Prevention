Authentication is the process of determining whether someone trying to log into the network is who they declare to be and the primary method of authentication is by the use of passwords.
Login names will probably be known to other users because of an organisationâ€™s policy of generating them but passwords must remain known only to the user and password rules should be included in the network policy.
Rules could include:

- Passwords should be at least 8 characters long. 
- They should contain both numbers and letters. 
- They should contain both upper and lower case letters. 
- They should contain at least one character such as:!,$,? etc. 
- Never use user identifiable items such as name, date of birth, phone number, postcode, car registration, etc.
- All passwords should be changed regularly. 
- Previous passwords must never be reused. 
- Passwords must never be written down. 
- Passwords must never be shared with other users. 

Passwords should be unpredictable as hackers may be trying to guess them and using brute force techniques.
