Organisations should have procedures in place to safeguard the security of the network and prevent problems occurring and also plans to be implemented if there is a problem.

These should include:
### 1 Acceptable use policy

An acceptable use policy is a set of conditions or rules that a network user must agree to comply with before they are allowed to use the network.
These are needed to ensure that the network is not harmed in any way or that its security is not jeopardised and ensure that all laws are complied with e.g. Data Protection Act.
The policy should include the regulations governing the use of portable devices as discussed in lesson 1 and some of the following items which could affect network security:

- Must at all times comply with the law.
- Must not interfere with any others’ use of the network.
- Must not access any program or data for which the user has not been authorised.
- Must not install software.

### 2 Backup policy
This policy is about the copying of programs and data stored on the network to safeguard them in case of natural or manmade disasters.
The policy could include the following items:

- Who is responsible for the backup.
- Which data will be backed up – full or incremental backups. (See section 1.7)
- When the backup is to me made e.g. during the night.
- How often backups will be made e.g. weekly, daily or even hourly if the data changes constantly.
- How the backups will be done e.g. tape, DVD, cloud storage.
- Where the backups will be kept e.g. on-site, off-site.
- How long the backups will be kept.

### 3 Disaster recovery policy
This is a set of procedures that the organisation will follow to restore normal network operations after the network has been compromised e.g. if data has been corrupted or deleted.
It could include the following items:

- How often it should be tested – many organisations never test the plan until there actually is a disaster only to find that it doesn’t work or is inadequate.
- It should list and consider all of the possible threats and what should be done to counteract them.
- List all outside agencies e.g. hardware and software suppliers who will respond quickly.
