All data that is transmitted or stored on a network must be considered at risk of being read by unauthorised personnel. It should therefore be converted into a form that they cannot understand.
Encryption is the scrambling of data into a form that cannot be understood by unauthorised recipients. The encrypted data must be decrypted back to its original form.
The encryption/decryption is carried out using a ‘cipher’ or ‘key’.
A common method is the use of a ‘public’ and a ‘private’ key.

- All users have both a public and a private key. 
- The public key is freely available to anyone but the private key is only known to the owner.
- Messages encrypted by a particular public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. 
- If person A wanted to send an encrypted fi le to person B, person A would encrypt it with person B’s public key. On receipt, person B would then decrypt the fi le with their private key.
