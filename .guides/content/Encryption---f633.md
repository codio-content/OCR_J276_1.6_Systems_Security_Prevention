Encryption involves the use of transforming a message sent across a network so that it cannot be understood if it is intercepted by a hacker. There will be a key that is used to decrypt the message at the other end. The main purpose of encryption is protect the confidentiality of data that is sent across a network. Imagine if you were to buy a product online and the packets of data containing your bank card details were intercepted? Hackers could potentially have access to your details and wipe your account.

Encryption dates back to the Egyptians right through to world war two when it was used to encrypt messages sent by governments and armies. Modern encryption plays a massive part of the security for online systems such as banking and communication.
