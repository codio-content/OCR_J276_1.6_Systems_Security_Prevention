For a Network to run efficiently and securely it is vital that a good network policy is followed. 
Some good practices for organisations to follow are as follows:

- Enforce the use of strong passwords by using a combination of letters, numbers and symbols.
- Ensure that SPAM filters are used on Email and up to date anti-virus software is in place.
- Any sensitive data that is transmitted must be encrypted
- By using user access levels you can limit the functionality available to certain users that might not have the skills or knowledge to use the network responsibly.
- Regular testing of the network and trying to break it is crucial to maintaining the security of it. Once weaknesses have been identified then they can be addressed internally before they are found by a hacker.
- Use of external storage could be disabled for certain users to stop the spread of malware.

By not following all of these guidelines then an organisation is at risk and very susceptible to attacks.
