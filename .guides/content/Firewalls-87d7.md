Firewalls are either software or hardware devices that protect against unauthorised access to a network, primarily from the internet. 
They can be configured to prevent communications from entering the network and also to prevent programs and users from accessing the Internet from the network.

For example, a firewall can inspect the incoming packets and reject those that are from IP addresses not on a trusted list or block communication to certain external IP addresses.
